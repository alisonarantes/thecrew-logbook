    { number: 1, difficulty: 1, title: "Notebook of the Pyke, Meg Diver, 04:08 a.m.", story: "My colleagues are pretty competent. All of them highly-regarded experts in their fields... But deep-sea experience? ... Negative. But that's why I'm here... Let's see how they can work together in the training exercises I will be coordinating." },
    { number: 2, difficulty: 2, title: "Notebook of the Pyke, Meg Diver, 03:16 p.m.", story: "Slowly but surely, our employers are managing to cough up a few details... they showed us two stone tablets... associated with the high cultures of the ancient Egyptians, Greeks, and Mayans... The crew is going to dive down and see if they can find out more... It's my job to make sure that they all get back on board safely." },
    { number: 3, difficulty: 3, title: "Notebook of the Pyke, Meg Diver, 11:42 p.m.", story: "It looks like the mission is going to become a little more involved than I thought... a habitat constructed on the ocean floor... we are supposed to be spending a month there... But first, we will be going over the three most important systems we'll be using down there: air, power, and heat." },
    { number: 4, difficulty: 4, title: "Notebook of the Pyke, Meg Diver, last moment in the fresh air", story: "This trip is going to offer a little taste of what will come later. An underwater baptism of fire... we'll be piloting the submarine ourselves... Your first descent into the deep sea is always something special. And to be perfectly honest, I'd rather not trust them with the steering anyway." },
    { number: 5, difficulty: 5, title: "Computer logbook of the Kench, Captain Meg Diver, Day 1", story: "Wham - that's how quickly you become captain. The Kench habitat is a hulking underwater station... I am practically the sole ruler of my own watery kingdom... The best idea would be to take a tour through the five areas of the habitat... The habitat's computer is supposed to collect status data and report it to the Pyke." },
    { number: 6, difficulty: 5, title: "Computer logbook of the Kench, Captain Meg Diver, still Day 1", story: "Such a rookie error right off the bat! ...Somebody... actually opened the porthole before the docking process was completed...

    { number: 7, difficulty: 6, title: "Computer logbook of the Kench, Captain Meg Diver, Day 2", story: "The crew is doing well, so we can get started... We will start by exploring the immediate surroundings of the habitat... I have a lot of experience underwater, but even for me this presents some completely new challenges... it would better not to assume that we can rely on outside help." },
    { number: 8, difficulty: 8, title: "Computer logbook of the Kench, Captain Meg Diver, Day 5", story: "Luckily, everything is going smoothly so far... I have the impression that somebody is getting a little too familiar with our chocolate supply... I think a little lecture about the importance of sharing might be in order.", rules: "At no point is a crew member allowed to have won two more “9” cards than any other crew member.", icons: { special: '9' } },
    { number: 9, difficulty: 7, title: "Computer logbook of the Kench, Captain Meg Diver, Day 7", story: "We have located a shipwreck near the habitat... it is a centuries-old ship from the Mediterranean region.

    { number: 10, difficulty: 4, title: "Computer logbook of the Kench, Captain Meg Diver, Day 8", story: "The wreck was a complete stroke of luck! ...we discovered another ancient and richly decorated stone tablet... an extensive hieroglyphic inscription. An ancient Egyptian tablet so close to the west coast of America?... These discoveries should not be delayed.", rules: "Your captain assumes all tasks or passes them to a willing crew member. If they are passed on, all communication has to take place before the first trick.", icons: { special: '🧑‍🚀' } },
    { number: 11, difficulty: 8, title: "Computer logbook of the Kench, Captain Meg Diver, Day 10", story: "I am irritated. We received a response from the Pyke... They seem somewhat ... pleased but not surprised... I have called a Kench-internal meeting... for now I think I'll keep the communications about the meeting on a secure channel." },
    { number: 12, difficulty: 8, title: "Computer logbook of the Kench, Captain Meg Diver, Day 11", story: "We have been able to confirm internally what we learned from the Pyke. The tablet is the missing upper portion of the Rosetta Stone... We have decided to check that, but have to proceed with extreme caution to avoid damaging the tablet.", rules: "No trick may be opened with a pink card or a submarine card.", icons: { special: ' rosa/sub' } },
    { number: 13, difficulty: 5, title: "Computer logbook of the Kench, Captain Meg Diver, Day 13", story: "There's one thing we know for sure: The hieroglyphs contain more writing than the other texts on the tablet... I am going to draw up a comprehensive plan to gather data about this area... Perhaps there is more that can be found.", rules: "Your captain assumes all tasks or passes them to a willing crew member. If they are passed on, all communication with the sonar token must be done before the first trick.", icons: { special: '🧑‍🚀' } },

Just as it was back then, we had an announcement beforehand... it comes at an inconvenient time — I would actually rather keep working.", rules: "You have 3 minutes and 30 seconds to complete the tasks. If you play without a time limit, the \"currents\" rule applies instead.", icons: { timer: '3:30', or: 'OR', comm: '?' } },
    { number: 15, difficulty: 6, title: "Computer logbook of the Kench, Captain Meg Diver, Day 17", story: "We have been attacked! During an outside operation, a whole swarm of jellyfish wandered into the habitat area... One of us is still out there... we have to help him get back to the habitat as quickly as possible.", rules: "You have 3 minutes to complete the tasks. If you play without a time limit, the \"rapture of the deep\" rule applies instead.", icons: { timer: '3:00', or: 'OR', comm: '-2' } },
    { number: 16, difficulty: 6, title: "Computer logbook of the Kench, Captain Meg Diver, Day 17", story: "We don't have much time. We did manage to save our crew member, but the jellyfish had already broken through the skin of his suit... Meanwhile, the infirmary has sprung a leak. We have to deal with both problems as quickly and efficiently as possible...", rules: "You have 2 minutes and 30 seconds minutes to complete the tasks. If you play without a time limit, then no communication is allowed instead.", icons: { timer: '2:30', or: 'OR', comm: 'X' } },

On top of that, our mission is on the verge of a breakthrough! We have found several remarkable sculptures in the wreck... they are in fact much older... We are working together so harmoniously, it's almost as if we had been doing this forever.", rules: "Free task selection applies." },
    { number: 18, difficulty: 9, title: "Computer logbook of the Nami, Captain Meg Diver, Day 24", story: "We have gotten our expedition submarine Nami going again. The inscriptions on the figures turned out to be coordinates, not words... The location is not far from our habitat, but we will be ready for anything... Like a black veil over the otherwise flawless sculptures, which we just can't quite put our fingers on." },
    { number: 19, difficulty: 9, title: "Computer logbook of the Nami, Captain Meg Diver, Day 24", story: "The coordinates led us to an underwater cave that is not down on any map... Cautiously, we are investigating its passages... I am navigating with extreme care. Finally, it's my chance to show what I can do.", rules: "As the first task, your captain must take the displayed task with the highest level of difficulty. The remaining tasks can be selected as usual in a clockwise direction.", icons: { special: '🧑‍🚀' } },
    { number: 20, difficulty: 10, title: "Computer logbook of the Nami, Captain Meg Diver, Day 24", story: "A moment of excitement. We were barely on our way when we had to turn right back... We seem to be standing before a gigantic network of intricate passageways... We'll have to resort to the Explorers... Hopefully our communication system will work inside the passageways.", icons: { comm_split: { '1-3': '', '4-6': '?', '7-9': '-2' } } },
    { number: 21, difficulty: 10, title: "Computer logbook of the Nami, Captain Meg Diver, Day 24", story: "Without our drone, we'd be up a creek without a paddle...

    { number: 23, difficulty: 11, title: "Computer logbook of the Nami, Captain Meg Diver, Day 24", story: "\"Mu.” That was the answer to our question about what our employers suspected might be down here. Our reaction was similarly profound: \"Huh?\"... we will have to snake our way through a dangerously narrow section of the cave. The best thing for us to do is follow single file...", rules: "Whoever wins the first trick must have won more tricks at any given time than any other crew member.

    { number: 25, difficulty: 12, title: "Computer logbook of the Nami, Captain Meg Diver, Day 26", story: "Following a brief stay in the habitat, we are back in the labyrinth.

Your captain, however, will always skip a selection and will therefore receive no tasks.", icons: { special: '🧑‍🚀 pulado', comm_split: { '1-3': '', '4-6': '?', '7-9': '-2' } } },

Apparently, Mu is the name of a continent that was inhabited 50,000 years ago by the Naacal... The whole story about Mu is most likely nothing more than a legend.
